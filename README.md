# circular_buffer
This is a hpp library for a circular buffer that tries to be stl like

## Status
Currently this is a work in progress, but the core functionality is there. I developed this because I didn't want to use boost at the time (their implementation will be infinitely better than mine), and I could not find another implementation that I liked.

## TODO
 * Implement Iterator properly
 * Add more test cases
